"""Cross-agent file state coordination.

Prevents mangled edits when concurrent subagents (same process, same
filesystem) touch the same file. Complements the single-agent path-overlap
check in ``run_agent._should_parallelize_tool_batch`` — this module catches
the case where subagent B writes a file that subagent A already read, so
A's next write would overwrite B's changes with stale content.

Design
------
A process-wide singleton ``FileStateRegistry`` tracks, per resolved path:

  * per-agent read stamps: {task_id: {path: (mtime, read_ts, partial)}}
  * last writer globally: {path: (task_id, write_ts)}
  * per-path ``threading.Lock`` for read→modify→write critical sections

Three public hooks are used by the file tools:

  * ``record_read(task_id, path, *, partial)`` — called by read_file
  * ``note_write(task_id, path)`` — called after write_file / patch
  * ``check_stale(task_id, path)`` — called BEFORE write_file / patch

Plus ``lock_path(path)`` — a context-manager returning a per-path lock to
wrap the whole read→modify→write block. And ``writes_since(task_id,
since_ts, paths)`` for the subagent-completion reminder in delegate_tool.

All methods are no-ops when ``HERMES_DISABLE_FILE_STATE_GUARD=1`` is set.

This module is intentionally separate from ``_read_tracker`` in
``file_tools.py`` — that tracker is per-task and handles consecutive-read
loop detection, which is a different concern.
